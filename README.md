# React useReducer Hook
I pushed only those files that I changed. If you want to run these files, first initiate the react library in any directory, then paste these files in the src folder. 
Once it is done, then run "npm start" in cmd. There are three files in the repository.
* index.js explains how useReducer hook works.
* useReducerContext.js This program shows how can we change state in Context API at the global level using useReducer, meaning state changes at the same time in 
different components.
* useStateContext.js This program shows how can we change state in Context API at the global level using useState, meaning state changes at the same time in 
different components.
